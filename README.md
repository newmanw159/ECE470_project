# ECE470_project

This project is for UIUC ECE 470 SP 2020. The readme inside the file is how to set up the copellia sim python API. The "theta" parameter inside the "project_update_1.py file is used to set the angles desired in radians. The python script will print out the final transform and give any warnings or errors in connecting with the simulation.
